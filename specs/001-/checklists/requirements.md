# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Business Management Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Specification maintains appropriate abstraction level and business focus

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All clarifications resolved:
1. Invoice numbering format: Simple sequential (INV-001, INV-002, etc.)
2. Sharing link expiration: Default 90-day expiration (configurable per link)
3. Audio recording retention: Manual management with Keep/Archive/Delete options

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Specification is comprehensive and well-structured

---

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - READY FOR PLANNING

**Passing Items**: 15/15 (100%)

**Blocking Issues**: None

**Completed Actions**:
- ✅ All 3 clarification questions resolved with user input
- ✅ Specification updated with design decisions
- ✅ New requirement added for audio recording storage management (FR-016)
- ✅ Functional requirements updated to reflect specific design choices
- ✅ Checklist validated and marked complete

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- OR use `/speckit.clarify` for deeper exploration of specific areas

## Notes

- Specification demonstrates excellent structure with **22 detailed functional requirements** (15 Must Have, 4 Should Have, 3 Nice to Have)
- Four comprehensive user scenarios provide clear context for development
- Success criteria include 18 measurable outcomes across functional, UX, security, and performance dimensions
- All 10 key entities properly defined with attributes, relationships, and business rules
- 15 assumptions documented to guide development decisions
- Risk assessment includes 9 identified risks with mitigation strategies
- Design decisions section clearly documents: invoice numbering, sharing link expiration, and audio retention policies

**Quality Assessment**: This is a high-quality, comprehensive specification that provides a strong foundation for implementation. All design decisions have been finalized and documented.

**Updated**: 2025-10-08 - All clarifications resolved, specification ready for planning phase.
