# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2025-10-08  
**Last Amended:** 2025-10-08

---

## Project Identity

**Name:** Student Record Management System (学生记录管理系统)

**Purpose:** A unified backend management platform designed for multi-business operations (education and technical services), enabling efficient operations, professional service delivery, and secure asset management.

**Scope:** This system provides automated financial invoicing with multi-rate support, rich media course logging capabilities, and highly encrypted storage for sensitive work assets.

---

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Light Minimalist Design

**Declaration:**  
All user interfaces MUST follow a light minimalist aesthetic with clean layouts, ample whitespace, and intuitive navigation. Visual complexity MUST be eliminated in favor of clarity and user focus.

**Rationale:**  
Minimalist design reduces cognitive load, improves user efficiency, and creates a professional appearance suitable for both educational and technical service contexts. Light color schemes enhance readability and reduce eye strain during extended use.

**Implementation:**
- Use light color palettes (whites, light grays, soft accents)
- Limit UI elements to essential functionality only
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Avoid decorative elements that do not serve functional purposes

---

### Principle 2: Code Clarity & Readability

**Declaration:**  
All source code MUST be written with clarity as the highest priority. Code MUST be self-documenting through clear naming, logical structure, and appropriate comments. Complex logic MUST be explained.

**Rationale:**  
Readable code reduces maintenance costs, facilitates collaboration, enables faster debugging, and ensures long-term project sustainability. Given the sensitive nature of financial and educational data, code clarity directly impacts security and reliability.

**Implementation:**
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow consistent coding style guides
- Write comments for non-obvious logic and business rules
- Refactor complex functions into smaller, focused units
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for APIs and modules

---

### Principle 3: Multi-Rate Financial Automation

**Declaration:**  
The system MUST support automated invoicing with configurable rate structures for different client types, service categories, and billing periods. Revenue calculations MUST be accurate and auditable.

**Rationale:**  
Managing education and technical services requires flexible billing models. Automation reduces manual errors, saves time, and provides accurate financial tracking essential for business operations and compliance.

**Implementation:**
- Support multiple rate tables per client/service type
- Automate invoice generation based on recorded activities
- Maintain detailed audit logs of all financial calculations
- Provide revenue reports segmented by client, service, and time period
- Ensure all calculations are deterministic and traceable

---

### Principle 4: Rich Media Course Logging

**Declaration:**  
Course logs MUST support rich media content including block-based editing, whiteboard drawings, and audio recordings. The logging system MUST preserve all instructional artifacts for future reference and quality assurance.

**Rationale:**  
Comprehensive course documentation enables quality review, supports student progress tracking, provides evidence of service delivery, and facilitates continuous improvement of teaching methods.

**Implementation:**
- Implement block-based editor for structured content entry
- Integrate whiteboard/canvas functionality for visual explanations
- Support audio recording and playback for session documentation
- Store all media assets with proper versioning and retrieval
- Enable search and filtering across all course log content

---

### Principle 5: Security & Encryption First

**Declaration:**  
All sensitive data including API keys, SSH credentials, financial records, and personal information MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access controls MUST follow principle of least privilege.

**Rationale:**  
The system stores highly sensitive business and personal data. Security breaches could result in financial loss, legal liability, and reputational damage. Encryption and access control are non-negotiable requirements.

**Implementation:**
- Encrypt sensitive data using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256 minimum)
- Use secure key management with rotation policies
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Maintain audit logs of all access to sensitive data
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

---

### Principle 6: Efficient Operations

**Declaration:**  
The system MUST optimize for operational efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, providing quick access to frequently needed information, and minimizing clicks required to complete common workflows.

**Rationale:**  
Time saved on administrative tasks translates directly to more time for value-added activities (teaching, technical work). Efficient operations improve user satisfaction and business profitability.

**Implementation:**
- Design workflows based on actual usage patterns
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Implement smart defaults and auto-fill where appropriate
- Optimize database queries and page load times
- Batch processing for recurring tasks

---

### Principle 7: Professional Service Delivery

**Declaration:**  
All system outputs (invoices, reports, course logs) MUST meet professional standards suitable for client-facing distribution. The system MUST support the delivery of high-quality, reliable services.

**Rationale:**  
Professional presentation reflects on business credibility and client confidence. Reliable systems ensure consistent service delivery and positive client experiences.

**Implementation:**
- Generate polished, branded documents
- Ensure data accuracy and completeness
- Provide professional formatting and templates
- Maintain system uptime and reliability (99.9% target)
- Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback

---

## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution may be amended when:
1. A principle no longer serves the project's mission
2. New principles emerge as critical to success
3. Clarifications or refinements improve guidance

**Procedure:**
1. Propose amendment with rationale in project documentation
2. Review impact on existing codebase and templates
3. Update version number according to semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Backward incompatible changes, principle removal
   - **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New principles added, significant expansions
   - **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes
4. Update `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` to current date
5. Propagate changes to all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy

- All changes MUST be tracked with version increments
- Version history MUST be maintained in git commit history
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in Sync Impact Report

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST reference relevant constitutional principles
- Code reviews MUST verify adherence to stated principles
- Quarterly reviews to assess if principles remain effective
- Annual review of constitution comprehensiveness

---

## Enforcement

Adherence to this constitution is enforced through:
- Code review processes
- Automated linting and testing aligned with principles
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) referencing principles
- Regular retrospectives evaluating principle compliance

Non-compliance should be addressed through:
1. Discussion of principle interpretation
2. Clarification or amendment of principle if needed
3. Refactoring or remediation of non-compliant code

---

**This constitution serves as the foundational governance document for the Student Record Management System. All development decisions should align with these principles.**
